libyaml++ is a C++ library for reading and writing YAML streams.  YAML stands
for YAML Ain't a Markup Language.  It is a portable data-serialization
protocol, designed primarily for readability by humans.  YAML plays well as a
protocol for message-based distributed processing systems.

YAML is somewhat comparable with XML in that it can be used as a protocol for
serializing structured, hierarchical documents.  XML, however, was designed to
be backwards-compatible with SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup Language,
which in turn was designed primarily to store structured documents.  YAML
therefore has more freedom of design.  When compared to XML, YAML elevates
its design goals to support data streams that show a balance between a
flexible syntax and readability.
