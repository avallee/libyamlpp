stream ::= stream_begin document* stream_end

# TODO:  how does a stream begin?  encoding information?
stream_begin ::= ""

# TODO:  how does a stream end?
stream_end ::= ""

#TODO:  is the second alternative correct?  what i want to say is that a
        document may start with document_begin, followed by a node and then
        either a document_end or nothing at all.  i don't think i can say
        it ends with document_end or stream_end, because a stream is defined
        to always end with a stream_end, so document shouldn't consume the
        final stream_end (and there should only be one stream end, right?).
