title: Define whitespace rules in grammar
desc: |-
  Currently there are /some/ productions that implement /some/ whitespace rules.  It will be nice if all productions clearly state where whitespace is allowed, where it is expected and where not.  It will be even better if we define these rules in an ordered manner;  specifically, I'm thinking about having the whitespace rules only in terminal productions.  For example:
  
   prod_a ::= term_a
            | term_a prod_a
   term_a ::= arbitrary_whitespace "A" arbitrary_whitespace
  
  as opposed to
  
   prod_a ::= arbitrary_whitespace term_a arbitrary_whitespace
            | arbitrary_whitespace term_a arbitrary_whitespace prod_a
