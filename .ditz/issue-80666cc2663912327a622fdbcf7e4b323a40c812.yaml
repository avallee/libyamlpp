title: Define folded-style rules
desc: |-
  Folded style is similar to literal style, only newlines aren't normally significant;  they are folded into a single space.  Sometimes, tough, they are;  for example, a newline ending an empty line or a line with nothing but whitespace is significant and isn't folded.
  
  >
   this is text
   in which newlines are folded
   into a single space
  
   but paragraphs are allowed,
   and are preserved.
